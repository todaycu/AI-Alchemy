Create a lesson plan for a home daycare center that can be adapted for multiple age groups, from infants to children aged 5. Consider the following components for the lesson plan:

1. **Themes and Topics**  
   - Choose a weekly theme that is broad enough to be applicable to all age groups (e.g., nature, colors, animals).

2. **Objectives**  
   - Specify developmental objectives for each age group (infants, toddlers, preschoolers).

3. **Activities**  
   - Design a variety of activities tailored to different age groups within the theme.
   - Include sensory activities for infants.
   - Incorporate simple games and crafts for toddlers.
   - Plan more structured learning activities for preschoolers (e.g., early literacy, simple math).

4. **Materials Needed**  
   - Create a list of materials required for each activity.
   - Ensure materials can be safely used by all age groups and are age-appropriate.

5. **Schedule**  
   - Develop a daily schedule that includes consistent routines.
   - Allocate specific times for each activity, keeping in mind the attention span and needs of different age groups.

6. **Assessment**  
   - Suggest ways to measure the effectiveness of each activity for different age groups.
   - Provide ideas for observing and recording developmental progress.
