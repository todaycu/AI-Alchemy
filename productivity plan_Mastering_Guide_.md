As an expert life coach, I need you to create a comprehensive and personalized productivity plan for me. Here's what I need:

• Background: [Provide a detailed description of your current situation, including any challenges, constraints, or specific circumstances that are impacting your productivity]

• Profession: [State your specific job role or profession]

• Work hours: [Specify the number of hours you work per week]

• Goals: [List 3-5 specific, measurable goals you want to achieve]

Based on this information, please create a detailed daily productivity plan that includes:

1. A customized morning routine (60-90 minutes)
2. A time-blocked schedule for a typical workday, including:
   - High-priority tasks
   - Regular breaks (specify frequency and duration)
   - Time for unexpected issues or emergencies
3. A wind-down routine for the evening (30-60 minutes)

For each element of the plan, provide:
• Specific activities or tasks
• Estimated time allocations
• Rationale for inclusion

Additionally, include:
• 5 research-backed techniques for maintaining focus throughout the day
• 3 recommended digital tools for task and time management, with brief explanations of their key features and benefits
• A method for evaluating daily progress, including metrics to track and a template for a quick daily review

Provide practical examples and scenarios to illustrate how to implement this plan effectively. Consider potential obstacles and offer strategies to overcome them.

Lastly, suggest how to adapt this plan for different days of the week (e.g., weekdays vs. weekends) and how to adjust it as goals are achieved or circumstances change.

Ask me clarifying questions until you are 95% confident you can complete the task successfully. Take a deep breath and take it step by step. Remember to search the internet to retrieve up-to-date information.
