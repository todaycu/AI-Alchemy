Create a proposal for a community-driven system to crowdsource and expand an online prompt library. The system should allow users to submit prompts based on specific frameworks and topics, with the following features:

- **Submission Platform**: Outline a platform where users can submit their prompts. Consider submission guidelines, and user accessibility.
- **Categorization System**: Detail how prompts will be categorized. Include categories such as:
  - Industry (e.g., biotech, technology, education)
  - Framework (e.g., SWOT analysis, Agile, Lean)
  - Topic (e.g., marketing strategies, data analysis)
- **Sorting and Filtering**: Explain how users can sort and filter prompts based on the outlined categories.
- **Recognition and Incentives**: Suggest a method to recognize top contributors, such as featuring the top three prompt engineers in a newsletter.
  
Consider how community input can be encouraged and managed effectively, including moderation strategies and quality control measures.
