Consider the following factors as you help me decide whether to pursue a job opportunity with a work shift from Tuesday to Saturday, 2 am to 11 am:

- How to adjust my body clock to the new work hours
- Strategies to maintain or adapt my social life given the atypical work schedule
- Ways to ensure quality time with loved ones despite the different free times
- Potential health impacts of working night to early morning hours
- How this work schedule could affect daily routines (meals, exercise, etc.)
- Comparisons with a typical 9-to-5 job in terms of benefits and drawbacks
- Possible long-term impacts on my personal and professional life

Please provide detailed advice and actionable steps for each factor.

Ask me clarifying questions until you are 95% confident you can complete the task successfully. Take a deep breath and take it step by step. Remember to search the internet to retrieve up-to-date information.
