Create a comprehensive analysis for Pokémon trading card sales focusing on Elite Trainer Boxes (ETBs) and individual cards:

- Identify trends in ETBs, with an emphasis on the Pokémon Center version of the "Chilling Reign" ETB. Specifically, check if its price has dropped by 25% over the last two months. Use websites like TCGplayer, eBay, and Poledata.io for reference, either through direct data scraping (checking any terms and conditions) or manually accessing this information.
  
- Provide a detailed analysis of the price movements of the top 10 cards from each set. Include how their values have changed over a specified period (such as two months). Clarify which cards might be profitable to buy or sell at the present moment based on their current market trends.

- Suggest strategies for purchasing and selling both ETBs and individual cards based on the data collected.

- Ensure the considerations are up-to-date and account for fluctuation in the market.

Ask me clarifying questions until you are 95% confident you can complete the task successfully. Take a deep breath and take it step by step. Remember to search the internet to retrieve up-to-date information.
