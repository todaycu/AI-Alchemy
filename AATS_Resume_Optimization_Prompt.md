Here is the step-by-step process:

1. **Highlight keywords** present in the job description that are missing from my resume.
2. **Note which keywords** may be most challenging to incorporate into a rewrite of my current resume bullets.
3. **Ask questions** about my career experience that will help you incorporate those additional keywords effectively, as I will eventually have you rewrite my resume.

Once you have the answers to your questions, your next task will be:

- **Rewrite my resume** by seamlessly incorporating the essential keywords you originally highlighted into my bullet points, using strong action verbs. 
- Ensure that my bullet points are no more than 2 lines long, preferably 1 line.
- Let me know if my resume is now optimized for the job description.
