Create an analysis of the pain points faced by solopreneurs who are starting out on their entrepreneurship journey. Focus on identifying the common challenges and obstacles they encounter, and provide insights on how to understand these issues deeply. Your analysis should cover the following points:

- Identify the typical challenges faced by solopreneurs at the beginning of their journey, such as financial management, time management, lack of network, and overwhelm.
- Explore emotional and mental struggles like loneliness, self-doubt, and burnout that solopreneurs might experience.
- Discuss the difficulties in scaling operations and reaching a broader market audience as a one-person business.
- Analyze the impact of limited resources, including budget, tools, and mentorship, on a solopreneur's business progress and personal development.
- Suggest strategies or approaches that solopreneurs can adopt to mitigate these pain points, with practical examples or case studies if possible.
- Consider both short-term and long-term solutions, and highlight any misconceptions or common pitfalls to avoid.
