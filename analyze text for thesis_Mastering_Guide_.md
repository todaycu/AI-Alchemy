### Introduction:
In the past decade, significant changes have occurred in the socio-economic arena, with the responsibility for supporting vulnerable populations being transferred to non-profit organizations (NPOs) through tenders. This shift has resulted in the allocation of substantial state funds to medical NPOs, necessitating these organizations to optimize their operations and create a positive impact on the community. The financial reports of a specific NPO indicate revenues of 200 million ILS from tenders and a volunteer work valuation of another 200 million ILS.

### Research Proposal:
The study aims to understand how the application of Scrum project management methodology in medical NPOs influences their ability to promote sustainability principles, contribute to the environment, and achieve better financial outcomes. The research will explore the potential of the Scrum methodology in Israeli medical NPOs and will focus on key aspects:
- The importance of transparency in medical NPOs in Israel, considering their revenues from government sources and the valuation of volunteer work, and management's accountability towards their employees.
- The impact of sector-specific specialization, particularly among the Haredi community, on the sustainability of these NPOs, noting the significant government assistance received by this demographic without clear measurement standards.
- The necessity of establishing measurement standards for the role of volunteer coordinators through the Scrum methodology.

### Objectives:
The primary objective of this research is to examine the systemic relationship between Scrum-based management and the sustainability of medical NPOs in Israel. It will also investigate the financial efficiency of administration and volunteer coordinators' work based on quantitative metrics in systemic aspects. Additionally, the study will evaluate the benefits of administrative management in large medical NPOs per Scrum principles, especially how this approach can enhance the efficiency and sustainability of the NPOs despite the absence of measurement standards, specifically focusing on volunteer coordinatorsâ€™ efficiency.

### Research Questions:
- What is the importance of financial transparency in medical NPOs in Israel, given their revenue from government sources, particularly regarding administrative expenses?
- How can a measurement standard be developed for volunteer coordinators to evaluate the value of their work and service quality?
- What productivity metrics can be developed to quantify the work of volunteer coordinators?
- What is the management's responsibility towards human resources, considering that NPOs rely on an economic model ensuring employee salaries while there remains a gap in human resource management responsibility?
- How does the specialization within the Haredi community in NPOs affect the sustainability of both the NPOs and the community?

### Conclusion:
This research will propose a framework grounded in the Scrum methodology for developing measurement standards for volunteer coordinators. The anticipated results are expected to provide insights into the impact of agile management on the administration in medical NPOs and contribute to enhancing the social activities within the community. Through this approach, it will be possible to support the empowerment of volunteers and the improvement of services offered to vulnerable populations, ensuring that budgetary investments yield positive and measurable outcomes.
