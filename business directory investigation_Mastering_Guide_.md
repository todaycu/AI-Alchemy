Investigate whether a client's business is listed on a range of business directories and document the details listed. Specifically, focus on finding listings for a hotel, including any under previous versions of its name. Aim to identify gaps or areas of improvement for the client's listings. Ensure the output is formatted as a spreadsheet containing:

- Client details
- Address
- URL
- Directory name
- Listed details

Additionally, upload and search through a spreadsheet with 314 directories to check for the hotel's URL & description.

Guidelines:
1. **Search each directory:** Check all 314 directories for the hotel's URL and the listed description.
2. **Previous names:** Include any variations or previous versions of the hotel's name in the search.
3. **Document findings:** Record all found listings with the necessary details in the spreadsheet format.
4. **Identify gaps:** Note any directories where the hotel is not listed or where the listed information is incomplete or inaccurate.
5. **Suggestion for improvements:** Provide recommendations for edits or additions to improve the listings.
