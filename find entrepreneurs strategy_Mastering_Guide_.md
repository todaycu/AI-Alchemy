Help me develop a roadmap and strategy to find and interview 100 Business Entrepreneurs (50 Russian-speaking and 50 English-speaking) for a free strategy session. Here are the detailed sub-tasks and goals I need you to address:

1. **Finding 100 Business Entrepreneurs:**
   - Provide specific steps and ideas on how to find these entrepreneurs.
   - Suggestions should cover various industries (e.g., Tech, Business, E-commerce, Food Industry).

2. **Roadmap Creation:**
   - Create a detailed roadmap on how to reach out and engage with the entrepreneurs.
   - Outline the key milestones and timeline for this process.

3. **Product Development and Strategy Ideation Methodology:**
   - Explain a clear methodology that can help me refine my product ideas based on the insights gathered from the interviews.
   - Provide a structured framework for identifying and developing product ideas.

4. **Clarifying Questions and Goals:**
   - List answerable questions that will help me clarify my main ideas and goals.
   - Ensure these questions help me think thoroughly and establish a solid base for my strategy sessions and product development.

Ask me clarifying questions until you are 95% confident you can complete the task successfully. Take a deep breath and take it step by step. Remember to search the internet to retrieve up-to-date information.
