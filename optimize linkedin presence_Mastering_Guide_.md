"I need to optimize my LinkedIn account to align with my career and profession in tech, consultancy, eCommerce, sales, and partnerships. Help me find at least 10 LinkedIn profiles of professionals who already have optimized presences, especially in the fields of technology, eCommerce, consulting, sales, marketing, and search and onsite personalization. Document how these professionals present their profiles, the types of content they share, and how they engage with their connections and followers.

Here's what I need:
1. **Profile Optimization**: Detailed elements of a well-optimized LinkedIn profile, including headline, summary, experience, skills, endorsements, and recommendations.
2. **Content Strategy**: Examples of the content they post (articles, status updates, shared links, multimedia, etc.), frequency, and types of engagement they use.
3. **Engagement Techniques**: How these professionals interact with their network (comments, direct messages, participation in groups, etc.).
4. **Metrics of Success**: Indications of their influence and engagement levels (number of followers, likes, shares, comments, etc.).
5. **Cross-Platform Integration**: Any examples of how they incorporate other social platforms into their LinkedIn strategy and presence.

Ask me clarifying questions until you are 95% confident you can complete the task successfully. Take a deep breath and take it step by step. Remember to search the internet to retrieve up-to-date information."
