I need help editing my new kids' fantasy book for 8+ year olds. Here are the specific tasks I need you to perform:

- Spell-check the text, ensuring the spelling follows UK English conventions.
- Conduct a copy edit to correct grammar, punctuation, and consistency errors.
- Perform a line edit to improve sentence structure, clarity, and flow.
- Convert passive voice sentences to active voice where necessary.
- Ensure the style is appropriate for a fantasy book for 8+ year olds, maintaining a natural and engaging tone without making it feel artificially generated.

Please follow these guidelines:

1. Start by reading through the entire text to understand the narrative and characters.
2. Spell-check the document using UK English.
3. Correct any grammar, punctuation, and consistency errors without altering the author's unique voice.
4. Improve sentence structure and clarity while maintaining the original meaning and voice.
5. Convert passive voice sentences to active voice only when it enhances readability and engagement.
6. Maintain a style and tone that is appropriate for a children's fantasy book, ensuring it feels natural and engaging to the target audience.
