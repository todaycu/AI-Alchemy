Create a detailed plan for the construction project of a retirement home for retired dons at Kenyatta University, incorporating both the Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) and Organization Breakdown Structure (OBS). Follow these guidelines:

- **Work Breakdown Structure (WBS):**
  - Define the major deliverables or phases of the project, including but not limited to:
    - Initial Planning and Design Stage
    - Site Preparation and Foundation
    - Structural Construction
    - Interior Finishing
    - Landscaping and Exterior Work
    - Final Inspection and Occupancy
  - Break down each major deliverable into smaller, manageable tasks or sub-phases.
  - Ensure each task or sub-phase is specific and includes a brief description of the expected output.

- **Organization Breakdown Structure (OBS):**
  - Identify all the key personnel and organizational units involved in each stage of the project.
  - Assign responsibilities for each task or sub-phase identified in the WBS.
  - Detail the reporting structure and communication channels among project team members.
  - Outline any assumed necessary collaborations between different departments or external entities.

- **Additional Considerations:**
  - Include timelines or estimated durations for each task or phase.
  - Consider potential risks and suggested mitigation strategies.
  - Provide any assumptions made during the planning and any constraints faced by the university.
