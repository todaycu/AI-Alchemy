The brutal truth about your "great" business idea: 

It's pretty meaningless. 

Here's why: 

Ideas are easy. Execution is hard. 

A decent idea with great execution? 

Worth 10x more than a great idea poorly executed. 

The harsh reality: 

1. Ideas are abundant 
2. Most people can't execute 
3. The market doesn't care about ideas 
4. Execution separates the winners 

Want to succeed? Do this: 

1. Ship MVP products 
2. Get customer feedback ASAP 
3. Use that feedback to improve it 
4. Ship again, get more feedback, repeat 

Remember: Ideas are cheap. Execution is everything. 

Stop planning. Start doing. 

Here's my take on pushing through the "hard" & starting:

What's one idea you can start executing today?

You think AI tools are useless. Think again.

I am aging a woman from 5 to 95 years old.

Everything is AI-made. Here's how.

#1. Midjourney

Midjourney is the best AI image generation.

I made carousels on how to best use it.

My goal was to see the effect of aging using AI.

So I generated...

→ multiple photos, 
→ of a single person, 
→ throughout her life.

I picked a South Indian woman. 

Here's my prompt (= request) on Midjourney:

Editorial style side-view medium-full photo shot on Fujifilm Pro 400H of a [AGE]-year-old South Indian woman with dark hair & captivating eyes glazing into the camera lens. She's wearing a South Indian traditional colorful dress. The soft interior background lighting and careful composition evoke a sense of refined simplicity and creative curiosity as she gazes fixedly at the camera lens --ar 1080:1350 --q 2 --upbeta --s 750 --v 5

☑ [AGE] : I picked 5-10-20-30-45-65-95
☑ --ar 1080:1350 : the image size (portrait)
☑ -q 2 --upbeta --s 750 --v 5 : my parameters

I tried to remain consistent by picking:

☑ Similar posture 
☑ Similar lens shot 
☑ Similar facial traits 
☑ Similar clothing tone
☑ Similar glazing & eyes

#2. Runway

Runway is the most versatile AI tool out there.

The possibilities are endless, and one of them is called "Frame interpolation".

It creates the missing images between 2 images.

Let's say you take pictures of the sky, and a plane goes by. You take 2 pictures of the same sky, but the plane is at different places.

If you run these 2 pictures on Runway, using "Frame interpolation", it will create a video with the plane moving from A to B.

That's how Runway "creates" aging between the photos: it imagines what frames are between the ones I uploaded.

I upload all of the 7 pictures I made on Midjourney.

Here are the parameters I selected for Runway:

☑ Advanced settings (on the right)
☑ Clip duration = 30 seconds
☑ Transition time = 85%

___

In my example on the video, I used an old form.

Before launching EasyGen (my SaaS), I asked questions to 700+ people on a form.

But I had to analyze it. I can't afford a data analyst.

This is my prompt:

"Act like a data analyst.

This excel are questions I asked to my community about my SaaS "EasyGen".

I want to know:

- how many followers they have
- what's their industry
- what's their budget

And all of the correlations between each of them.

Step 1: Clean all of the data.
Step 2: Talk about your strategy to land me a detailed report as a data analyst.
Step 3: Draw conclusions from it on what I should do, and why.

Make sure to treat the 3 questions as one form, and not each of them separately.

Take a deep breath and work on this problem step by step."

I will share the results in the comment section.

The real reason most businesses fail: 

It's not competition. 
It's not lack of funding. 
It's not market conditions. 

It's this: 

Entrepreneurs are trying to solve a problem nobody cares about. 

Here's how to avoid this trap: 

1. Talk to prospects before you build 
2. Identify pain points, not assumptions 
3. Create a solution they'd pay for today 
4. Start with a minimum viable product 
5. Get feedback early and often 
6. Iterate based on real user data 
7. Scale when you have product-market fit 

Remember: A great product doesn't guarantee success. 

A product that solves a *real* problem does. 

Here's how to build one you can test in just 27 minutes:

What problem are you solving, and how do you know it's real?

I used to be depressed, broke, and anxious. 

Now, I only work 4 hours per day, travel the world, and make $1.23 million dollars every month. 

10 habits that transformed my life:

1. Daily Deep Work

Dedicate the first few hours of your day to deep, focused work on your needle-moving work.

No phone, no social media, no distractions.

This is when your mind is freshest and most creative.

Protect this time at all costs.

2. The AED System

Automate, Eliminate, Delegate

Ruthlessly apply this system to every task.

• Automate repetitive tasks
• Eliminate unnecessary ones
• Delegate what does not require your unique skills

Your time is gold, start acting like it.

3. Quarterly Resets

Every quarter, take a step back, take a break, and reassess your goals, strategies, and habits.

What's working? What's not? Make adjustments.

Regular resets ensure that I stay aligned with my long-term vision and core values.

4. Focus on the 4 W of Work

Optimize the Who, What, Where, and When of your work:

• Who: Surround yourself with high-performers
• What: Focus on high-impact tasks
• Where: Create an optimal environment
• When: Leverage your natural energy

Small tweaks yield huge gains.

5. Sobriety

Eliminating alcohol was a game-changer for my productivity and clarity.

No hangovers, brain fog, or wasted time.

Sobriety allows you to operate at your peak consistently.

You need to be sober to change your life for the better.

6. No Agenda, No Meeting

With my team, if a meeting doesn't have a clear agenda and desired outcome, it doesn't happen.

Period.

This simple rule eliminates countless hours of pointless meetings.

Work matters, but most of your meetings don’t.

7. No Meetings in the Morning

Mornings are for deep work, not meetings.

Protect your peak creative hours.

Schedule meetings in the afternoon when your energy naturally dips.

Systemize your life.

8. Hell Yes or No

This is an extension of AED.

If an opportunity or request isn't a "Hell Yes!", it's a no.

Ruthlessly guard your time and attention.

Saying no to the mediocre allows you to say yes to the exceptional.

9. Personal Time/Energy Audit

Track how you spend your time for a week.

Categorize activities as energizing or draining.

Then, systematically eliminate or minimize the draining activities.

The time audit raises your hourly rate by thousands of dollars.

10. Daily Exercise

Those who prioritize fitness enjoy a life expectancy up to 7 years longer.

Your quality and duration of life is determined by your fitness habits.

Exercise is key to unlocking your full potential.

I don’t care if it sounds corny: health is wealth.
