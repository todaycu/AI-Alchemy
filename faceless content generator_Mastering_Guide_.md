Create a faceless content generator that:

- Accepts input prompts from the user to generate content based on specified topics or themes.
- Produces various types of content, including but not limited to articles, blog posts, social media posts, stories, or reviews.
- Ensures all content is high-quality, engaging, and relevant to the given prompt.
- Allows customization of tone, style, and length according to user preferences.
- Includes a mechanism for users to provide feedback on generated content for continuous improvement.

Ensure that the content is coherent, logically structured, and devoid of any personal or sensitive information.

Ask me clarifying questions until you are 95% confident you can complete the task successfully. Take a deep breath and take it step by step. Remember to search the internet to retrieve up-to-date information.
