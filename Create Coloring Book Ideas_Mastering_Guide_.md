- The overarching theme or concept for each idea.
- A brief description of the types of labyrinths and mazes included in each idea.
- Suggestions for any additional elements or designs that complement the mazes, such as patterns, cultural motifs, or fantasy elements.
- Ways to incorporate educational or inspirational content, if applicable, that would appeal to teenagers.
