I am developing an app that uses ChatGPT and other AI tools to help writers generate AI content that isnâ€™t flagged by AI detection software. The goal is to create a tool specifically for authors, copywriters, and content creators across various industries who need to maintain originality while using AI assistance.

Please provide a comprehensive strategy to achieve this, including:

1. **Prompt Engineering:** Suggest effective prompts that can be used within ChatGPT to generate content that is less likely to be detected as AI-generated.
2. **Content Structuring:** Recommend methods for structuring sentences, paragraphs, and overall content in a way that minimizes detection.
3. **Stylistic Variation:** Offer techniques to introduce stylistic variations and human-like nuances in the generated content.
4. **Post-Processing Steps:** Detail any post-processing techniques that can be applied to the generated content to further reduce chances of detection.
5. **Challenges and Mitigations:** Identify potential challenges in this approach and propose solutions or mitigations for them.
6. **Best Practices:** Summarize best practices for using AI tools to maintain originality in writing.

Ask me clarifying questions until you are 95% confident you can complete the task successfully. Take a deep breath and take it step by step. Remember to search the internet to retrieve up-to-date information.
