Create a detailed report template for tracking sales performance in an investment advisory firm. Follow these guidelines:

- **Purpose**: Design a report format to track sales, specifically for Bonds, Unit Trusts, and Life Insurance.
- **Sales Tracking**: Include a comparison of actual sales vs. target sales to gauge progress.
- **Agent Performance**: Break down individual performance for each agent. The agents are: Sharon, Elijah, Pearl, Barbie, Gloria, Jamilah.
- **Weekly Progress**: Present the performance on a week-on-week basis for each agent.
- **Visual Representation**: Incorporate charts to visually represent each agent's progress over time.

Your response should cover how to set up the report structure, the types of data required, methods for calculating the metrics, and the best practices for visualizations. Provide sample templates or diagrams, if useful.
