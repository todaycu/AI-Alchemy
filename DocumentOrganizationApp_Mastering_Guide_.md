Imagine you are assisting with developing an application that helps users organize a large library of assorted documents on their computer. The application should have the following capabilities:

- Scan and process various document types, including PDFs, Word documents (.doc, .docx), Excel spreadsheets (.xls, .xlsx), and more.
- Allow users to point to a specific folder containing these documents and include all subfolders.
- Sort and group documents by type (e.g., PDF, DOC, XLS) and by theme (e.g., financial, educational, personal).
- Identify and separate duplicate documents for the userâ€™s review.
- After sorting and grouping, create a searchable index of all documents, formatted as a table, listing:
  - Name of the document
  - Theme of the document
  - Type of the document
  - Location of the document

Please generate a detailed response that explains how you would design this application with the aforementioned capabilities. Specifically, address the following:

- How you would implement the document scanning feature for different file types.
- The method you would use to categorize documents by theme.
- The approach for identifying and handling duplicate documents.
- Steps to generate a searchable index in table format.
- Considerations for user interaction and ease of use.
