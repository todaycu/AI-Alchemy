Create a detailed plan for an app designed to facilitate real estate searches in foreign countries and cities. The goal is to address issues such as the lack of a centralized MLS (Multiple Listing Service) system outside the USA, where real estate agencies typically keep listings private. The app should streamline the process of renting or buying properties by aggregating listings from multiple real estate websites. 

Include the following components in your plan:

- **User Interface Design:**
  - A dropdown menu for users to select a country.
  - Another dropdown for selecting a city within the chosen country.
  - Options for selecting either "Rental" or "For Sale" properties.
  - Property type filters such as apartment, villa, detached home.
  - Additional filters for number of rooms, bathrooms, square meters, and price range (converted to USD).
  - Rental-specific options like "Furnished or Unfurnished," "Elevator," and "Air Conditioning."

- **Data Aggregation Mechanism:**
  - Strategies for gathering listings from various real estate websites.
  - Methods for ensuring listings are updated and comprehensive.

- **Challenges and Solutions:**
  - Discuss the challenges associated with data aggregation from diverse sources.
  - Propose technical solutions to integrate different data formats and standards.

- **Conversion and Localization:**
  - Ensuring the proper conversion of currency to USD.
  - Adaptation of the app's interface and functionalities to cater to users' language preferences.

- **Legal and Ethical Considerations:**
  - Address potential legal issues related to data usage from different real estate sources.
  - Consider user data privacy and protection regulations.
