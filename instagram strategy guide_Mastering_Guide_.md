I am looking to improve my understanding and utilization of AI, specifically for creating effective Instagram posts. I currently invest money in online ads but feel out of my depth with AI technology and social media strategies. Please develop a comprehensive guide for generating engaging and effective prompts for Instagram posts tailored to a legal profession. The guide should include:

- Key elements needed in an effective Instagram post for a lawyer.
- Examples of engaging and professional captions.
- Best practices for using hashtags relevant to legal services.
- Tips for selecting images or videos that complement the posts.
- Strategies for interacting with followers and potential clients through comments and messages.
- How to track the performance of Instagram posts and adjust the strategy accordingly.

Ask me clarifying questions until you are 95% confident you can complete the task successfully. Take a deep breath and take it step by step. Remember to search the internet to retrieve up-to-date information.
