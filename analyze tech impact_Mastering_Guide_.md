Understanding the math and code powering AI and the various strategies employed by AI to model answers to prompts, besides predictive analytics.

Please cover the following sub-tasks:
1. Explain the fundamental mathematical concepts that underpin AI models (e.g., linear algebra, calculus, probability, and statistics).
2. Describe the coding processes involved in building AI models, including common programming languages and frameworks used (e.g., Python, TensorFlow, PyTorch).
3. Discuss alternative strategies to predictive analytics that AI uses to model responses to prompts (e.g., knowledge graphs, rule-based systems, reinforcement learning).
4. Provide interesting and recent AI news of a technical nature.

Ask me clarifying questions until you are 95% confident you can complete the task successfully. Take a deep breath and take it step by step. Remember to search the internet to retrieve up-to-date information.
