### ChatGPT Prompt:

I need your help to create an artificial intelligence application designed to support interactive and efficient learning. The AI should have the following features and capabilities:

- Allow users to input various types of content: YouTube video links, Spotify podcast links, documents, images, and web page links.
- Analyze the content from the audio and/or video itself, not from descriptions.
- Convert audio into text and generate various forms of study material:
  - Study guides
  - Summaries
  - FAQs
  - Practical examples and more
- Provide responses based on content analysis. For example, if a user inputs a video about hormonal balance and asks for "practical examples about hormonal balance," the AI should generate an informed response based on the video's content.
- Handle long content (up to 5 hours) and translate the information into English, Spanish, French, and/or Portuguese.
- Make learning more accessible and personalized for different users.
- Include text-to-speech functionality so users can choose to read or listen to the generated information.
- Provide interactive capabilities allowing users to ask questions directly to the AI and receive responses based on the analyzed content.

Please create a detailed, step-by-step guide for developing this AI application, including the following:
1. Required technologies and tools (e.g., natural language processing algorithms, translation services, audio-to-text converters, etc.)
2. Architecture design and workflow.
3. Steps for content analysis and text conversion.
4. Implementation of multi-language translation.
5. Interactive response capabilities based on the analyzed content.
6. User interface design considerations for ease of use and accessibility.
