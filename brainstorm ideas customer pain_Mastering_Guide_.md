- **Problem**: Clearly define the common pain points and challenges faced by the target audience (e.g., project managers, team leaders) that the new tool aims to solve.
- **Agitate**: Illustrate the consequences, stress, or complications arising from these pain points to evoke an emotional response.
- **Solution**: Present the new project management tool as the answer to these challenges, highlighting its features, benefits, and unique selling points.

Provide examples and ensure that the language is persuasive and engaging.
