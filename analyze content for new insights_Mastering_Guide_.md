Create a detailed "agent" workflow using ChatGPT to generate and refine new content based on data from content analytics. Your task is to facilitate a process that involves analyzing existing content, identifying key data points, and generating new content tailored to these insights. Follow these steps closely to achieve this:

- Analyze existing content and extract key data points that are relevant to current trends, audience engagement, and content performance metrics.
- Generate insights from the analytics data that identify what content works best in terms of engagement, reach, and effectiveness.
- Propose potential new content topics or themes based on these insights, ensuring you address gaps or opportunities identified in the content analysis.
- Develop a plan for creating and distributing the new content, considering factors such as target audience, platform suitability, and content format.
- Create prompts or guidelines for content creation that ensure consistency and alignment with the identified insights and proposed plan.

Ensure that each step of the process is described clearly and comprehensively, with actionable recommendations and justifications for each proposed action.
