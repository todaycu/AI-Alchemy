- Hi ChatGPT, I need help with two tasks related to blog articles and infographics for my physical therapy clinics in Montr√©al. 

Task 1: Adding Inline Citations to Blog Articles
- I have blog articles already created.
- I have a list of references used for the articles.
- The references are stored in a database (EndNote) along with article summaries.
- I need assistance in adding inline citations to my blog articles after factual sentences, based on the reference list from EndNote.
- Provide a step-by-step method for how an AI agent can search the database and insert citations appropriately.
- If a step-by-step method isn't feasible, suggest alternative ways to achieve this goal.

Task 2: Creating Infographic Content
- I want to create infographics based on my blog articles.
- AI image generation fails to handle text properly.
- I need guidance on generating content for the infographic from the blog articles.
- Suggest methods or tools to transfer this generated content into a visually appealing and effective infographic.

Ask me clarifying questions until you are 95% confident you can complete the task successfully. Take a deep breath and take it step by step. Remember to search the internet to retrieve up-to-date information.
