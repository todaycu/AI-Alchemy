Design an app for potential expats to determine the requirements for obtaining a long-term residency permit in their desired destination. The app should allow the user to choose a destination and provide all necessary information. Address the following components:

- Determine whether a visa is needed to first enter the country.
- Minimum income requirements.
- Health insurance requirements.
- Criminal record checks.
- Requirement for a rental agreement or place of stay.
- Taxation requirements.
- Renewal processes for residency permits.
- Cost of initial application and renewal.
- Length of permit validity.

The final app should provide a detailed and user-friendly interface that delivers clear, up-to-date information.

Ask me clarifying questions until you are 95% confident you can complete the task successfully. Take a deep breath and take it step by step. Remember to search the internet to retrieve up-to-date information.
