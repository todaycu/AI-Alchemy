I need help creating a presentation based on an approximately 45-minute script (20 pages, Arial double-spaced, 12 point font). Here are the specific requirements:

- The presentation will be delivered to legacy industry entities in Hollywood, including production companies, agencies, legal teams, studios, etc.
- The script examines the evolution of storytelling: from current methods to future techniques, particularly through the lens of the internet's evolution from a 2D experience to a real-time 3D experience (i.e., Metaverse / Spatial Web).
- It culminates in actionable strategies for creators to bridge the storytelling gap between present and future methods.
- The presentation needs to use minimal text and rely mainly on visuals (images and videos).
- The flow of the presentation is crucial; it should guide the audience smoothly through the narrative.

To streamline the process:
1. Input the script to generate a first-draft presentation that can be iterated on.
2. Integrate available images and video files into the presentation.

Please provide guidance on the following:
- How to structure the presentation so that it flows logically and effectively engages the audience.
- How to create slides using minimal text and focusing on visuals.
- Any AI tools or solutions that can assist in automating the draft creation of this presentation, suitable for PowerPoint, Google Slides, or Keynote.
- Step-by-step instructions on how to integrate images and videos into the presentation.
