Create a story outline and concept for a 12-page illustrated book featuring a chihuahua character. The chihuahua embodies the personality traits of a stereotypical grumpy old man, who is particularly irate about contemporary issues.

- **Character Development**: 
  - Define the key personality traits of the chihuahua, highlighting his grumpiness and his unique way of expressing displeasure.
  - Describe how his size and characteristic demeanor contribute to the comedic aspect of the stories.

- **Contemporary Problems**: 
  - List out current societal issues and everyday annoyances that the chihuahua finds particularly bothersome. Consider issues that can be humorously exaggerated from the perspective of a chihuahua/man.
  
- **Story Structure**: 
  - For each of the 12 pages, draft a brief narrative or idea where the chihuahua encounters one of these problems.
  - Ensure each page has a clear setup, climax, and resolution that follows a logical sequence contributing to the overall theme.
  
- **Visual and Textual Elements**:
  - Suggest visual elements or illustrations that could accompany each page, making sure they reinforce the humorous tone.
  - Provide sample dialogue or commentary from the chihuahua that reflects his grumpy and old-fashioned viewpoints.
