Create a detailed explanation of medical test results at a 5th-grade reading level. The explanation should encompass various types of tests including:

- MRI scans
- X-rays
- Blood work
- Cancer screenings

For each type of test, provide an easy-to-understand interpretation of what the results mean, including:

1. General overview of what the test is looking for or what part of the body it examines.
2. Explanation of key terms commonly found in results, using simple language.
3. Description of normal vs. abnormal results, with clear examples.
4. Identification of any thresholds within the results that could indicate areas for health improvement, and suggest basic, actionable steps someone might take to improve these results.
5. Consideration of factors that might influence results such as existing or prior health issues.

Ensure the explanation is comprehensive and accessible for someone without a medical background.
