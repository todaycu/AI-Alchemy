Help me create a study plan to prepare for the medical residency exam. Include detailed strategies to maintain discipline and stay on track. I need the plan to:

1. Outline a weekly schedule with specific study times and breaks.
2. Include a variety of study methods (e.g., reading, practice tests, group study, etc.).
3. Provide techniques to stay motivated and focused.
4. Offer tips for managing stress and avoiding burnout.
5. Recommend tools or resources that can aid in studying.
6. Suggest ways to periodically assess my progress and make necessary adjustments.

Ask me clarifying questions until you are 95% confident you can complete the task successfully. Take a deep breath and take it step by step. Remember to search the internet to retrieve up-to-date information.
