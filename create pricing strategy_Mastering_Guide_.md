Create a pricing strategy for a new product entering the market by focusing on value-based pricing. Consider the following components to generate a specific price recommendation:

- **Value Proposition:** Identify and describe the unique value the product provides to the customer. What benefits does it offer that differentiate it from competitors?
  
- **Target Audience:** Define the target group for this product. What are their demographics, purchasing power, preferences, and needs? How does the product align with their values and expectations?

- **Competitive Analysis:** Analyze the pricing strategies of direct and indirect competitors. How are their products priced, and what market positions do they hold?

- **Market Research:** Utilize data sources to understand current market trends relevant to the productâ€™s industry. Consider consumer behavior, demand fluctuations, and economic indicators.

- **Price Sensitivity:** Evaluate how sensitive the target market is to changes in price. Consider conducting price elasticity analysis to predict potential demand changes with price adjustments.

- **Psychological Pricing:** Explore pricing strategies that can leverage psychological factors. Consider techniques such as charm pricing, anchoring, and discount strategies.

Using this information, provide a detailed pricing recommendation, explaining your rationale behind the chosen price point. Ensure that the final price aligns with the value perception among potential consumers while remaining competitive within the market landscape.
