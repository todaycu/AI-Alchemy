I'm trying to understand stock option strategies as a beginner. Please help me with the following:

- Explain the "Covered Call" strategy in detail. How does it work, and what are the potential risks and benefits?
- I have 500 shares of RIOT purchased at a price of $7.04 each. I am using Robinhood to execute these trades. How should I properly roll up or roll down the covered call option on a weekly basis to maximize my returns or minimize potential losses?
- Provide step-by-step guidance on how to practically implement the weekly "Covered Call" strategy specifically using Robinhood.
- Briefly introduce and explain the concept of "Covered Puts." How do they differ from "Covered Calls," and what situations may make them beneficial or detrimental as a strategy?

Ask me clarifying questions until you are 95% confident you can complete the task successfully. Take a deep breath and take it step by step. Remember to search the internet to retrieve up-to-date information.
