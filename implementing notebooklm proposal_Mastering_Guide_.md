Create a detailed proposal for implementing the Google NotebookLM tool as a knowledge hub powered by AI. The proposal should address the following aspects:

- Highlight that Google NotebookLM is free and accessible to anyone with a Google account.
- Explain that the tool is powered by Gemini and features an extensive library of up to 25 million words.
- Describe how the tool is trained on internal documentation and files, offering a personalized AI collaborator experience.
- Detail the interaction capabilities with sources by writing questions or instructions into a chat box.
- List supported source types for NotebookLM: Google Docs, Google Slides, PDF files, Text and Markdown files, Web URLs, Copy-pasted text, YouTube URLs of public videos, and Audio files.
- Clarify that the Google Terms of Service apply to all users and ensure that NotebookLM does not train on any user data.
- Outline a plan to organize the knowledge hub with separate notes for major topics such as Business Intelligence (BI), Service Desk, Onboarding Process, and Troubleshooting.

Ensure the proposal is structured logically and provides a comprehensive understanding of how Google NotebookLM can be utilized effectively within the organization.
