Please help me to edit a prayer book intended for an American audience. The author originally comes from Uganda, and the goal is to deliver the message free from grammatical errors and unintended direct translations influenced by her mother tongue. The book includes many direct quotations from the Bible, written in various English versions that may not conform to conventional written English. Here's what needs to be done:

- Correct grammatical errors throughout the book.
- Identify and resolve instances of unintended direct translations that could confuse an English-speaking audience.
- Ensure that the direct quotations from the Bible are consistent with conventional written English versions commonly used in America, without altering the intended meaning.
- Maintain the tone and spirituality of the prayer book while making it accessible to an American audience.
