**Please include the following details:**
- **Breakfast, lunch, and snacks** planned for a week (Monday to Friday)
- **Portion sizes** suitable for different age groups (infants, toddlers, preschoolers)
- **Nutritional guidelines** as per CACFP, including the appropriate serving sizes for grains, proteins, vegetables, fruits, and dairy
- **Seasonal fresh produce** available during the specified week to ensure the meals are both nutritious and cost-effective
- **Variety and balance** in meals throughout the week to encourage healthy eating habits among children

**Additional considerations:**
- Cater to common dietary restrictions (e.g., vegetarian options, allergen-aware choices)
- Emphasize safety in food preparation and storage
