Create an annual plan for Deputyship for a Training Strategy based on a five-year plan. The goal is to develop a clear and easy-to-follow plan specifically for a university setting. The plan should contain:

- Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound (SMART) objectives.
- Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) to monitor the progress and effectiveness of the strategy.

Your plan should include the following components:

1. **Executive Summary**:
   - Brief overview of the five-year plan
   - Importance of the annual plan within the larger strategy

2. **Objectives**:
   - List 3-5 main objectives in the SMART format
   - Ensure each objective aligns with the five-year plan

3. **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)**:
   - Define 2-3 KPIs for each objective
   - Explain how each KPI will be measured and monitored

4. **Action Plan**:
   - Detailed steps to achieve each objective
   - Timeline and milestones for each step
   - Resources needed (human, financial, technological)

5. **Roles and Responsibilities**:
   - Define the roles and responsibilities of the Deputyship and other key personnel
   - Explain how coordination will be maintained

6. **Monitoring and Evaluation**:
   - Describe the process for monitoring progress
   - Outline the evaluation criteria and frequency
   - Adjustments/modifications based on evaluation outcomes
