Compose an email to your landlords requesting an early termination of your lease, aiming for a mutually beneficial outcome for both parties. Incorporate the following details and instructions into the email:

- Use a warm and engaging tone throughout the email, reflecting your personal voice.
- Mention that you began leasing two properties in Carolina Beach, NC, in April 2023 with the intention of creating short-term rentals on Airbnb and VRBO. The landlords were aware of this intention from the start.
- Explain that you are currently in your second year of the lease after renewing it this year.
- Describe the properties as beautiful, newly built, and popular with guests, earning you SUPER HOST status on Airbnb.
- Despite the popularity, note that the location is seasonal and was adversely affected by recent hurricanes, impacting tourism and your profitability.
- Inform them of a conversation with your co-host, revealing that if you do not renew the lease for a third term, the landlords are interested in taking over the properties as turn-key rentals.
- Propose returning the properties fully set up and ready for them to start generating revenue immediately, thereby benefiting both parties.
- Conclude with an expression of appreciation for their consideration and a willingness to discuss this further to reach an amicable solution.
