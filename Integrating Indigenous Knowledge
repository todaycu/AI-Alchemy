Create a comprehensive course description and program for professional development services aimed at mainstream/government/crown agencies. The goal is to integrate indigenous knowledge systems, specifically Māori narratives, without simply translating them into English but rather conceptualizing the ideas in a way that captures their full extent. The course should help improve outcomes for both the agencies and communities facing greater levels of inequities, fostering shared values.

Structure your response to include the following components:

1. **Course Description**:
   - Write an engaging and detailed course description that outlines the purpose, target audience, and key elements of the course.
   - Emphasize the integration of Māori perspectives and the value of indigenous knowledge in shaping inclusive and diverse communities.

2. **Outcomes**:
   - Define the key outcomes that participants will achieve by the end of the course.
   - Ensure these outcomes reflect an improved understanding and application of indigenous knowledge systems in their respective roles.

3. **Assessment Matrix**:
   - Develop an assessment matrix that outlines how participants' understanding and application of the course content will be evaluated.
   - Include both qualitative and quantitative measures.

4. **Learning Objectives**:
   - Identify specific learning objectives that align with the course description and desired outcomes.
   - Ensure these objectives cover cognitive, affective, and practical skills.

5. **Deliverables**:
   - List the deliverables participants are expected to produce during and after the course.
   - Include projects, reports, reflections, or practical applications that demonstrate their learning.

6. **Connection Opportunities**:
   - Describe how the course will provide opportunities for participants to connect the indigenous knowledge systems to their work, promoting better outcomes for both the agencies and the communities they serve.
   - Include strategies for fostering ongoing engagement and collaboration.

Focus on the needs of a district council/local government body leadership course from a Māori perspective. Emphasize inclusivity, community care, and shared values over patriarchal and western-dominated approaches.
