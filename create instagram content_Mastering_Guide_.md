Create 30 days of content for Instagram tailored to busy professionals experiencing perimenopause/menopause, with the goal of addressing their pain points and providing tips and resources. Each day's content should consist of the following:

- A short, engaging caption (100-150 words) that identifies a common pain point related to perimenopause/menopause.
- One practical tip or resource tailored to managing or alleviating that specific pain point.
- Suggested hashtags relevant to health, wellness, and menopause.

Ensure that the content is varied, covers different aspects of their lives (e.g., physical health, mental well-being, nutrition, work-life balance), and is empowering and supportive.

Develop a schedule outline that specifies which topics will be covered on each day, ensuring a logical flow and even distribution of content.

Ask me clarifying questions until you are 95% confident you can complete the task successfully. Take a deep breath and take it step by step. Remember to search the internet to retrieve up-to-date information.
