I run a Pokemon card business focused on selling sealed Pokemon Center Elite Trainer Boxes (ETBs) and booster boxes, primarily through TCG Player and eBay. I need assistance in developing a strategy to maximize my business success, including understanding market trends to determine optimal buying and selling times. Additionally, I have a substantial number of bulk cards I need to sell. I am willing to invest up to $3,000 to enhance my business operations. Please help me with the following:

- Provide guidance on how to analyze trends in the Pokemon card market, specifically for ETBs and booster boxes. Suggest tools and resources that can help track these trends effectively.
- Propose a strategy for leveraging TCG Player and eBay efficiently to maximize sales. Include any tips for listing, pricing, or marketing these products on these platforms.
- Suggest methods for selling bulk Pokemon cards successfully. Consider platforms, bundling strategies, or value-added services that can increase sales potential.
- Offer advice on effectively allocating the $3,000 investment to improve my business operations, such as marketing, inventory acquisition, or technology tools.

Ask me clarifying questions until you are 95% confident you can complete the task successfully. Take a deep breath and take it step by step. Remember to search the internet to retrieve up-to-date information.
