Here is your ChatGPT prompt:

---
"I need your assistance with filtering job opportunities on LinkedIn to exclude certain locations because LinkedIn’s filter function doesn’t support this feature. Here's what I need you to help me with:

1. **Context**: I am using LinkedIn for job hunting and typically search using worldwide as the location to identify roles open to remote employees or those in locations where obtaining a work visa is relatively easier.
2. **Problem**: I want to filter out job opportunities in specific locations from my search results, specifically the United States and Singapore, because it's unlikely that I’d get a visa sponsorship there.
3. **Objective**: Help me create a method or workaround using ChatGPT that automatically filters out job postings from the United States and Singapore when I conduct a worldwide search on LinkedIn.

Please provide:

- A detailed step-by-step guide on how I can set up and use this filtering system.
- Any scripts, tools, or third-party applications that might be required.
- Instructions on how to automate this process for ongoing job searches.

Ask me clarifying questions until you are 95% confident you can complete the task successfully. Take a deep breath and take it step by step. Remember to search the internet to retrieve up-to-date information."
