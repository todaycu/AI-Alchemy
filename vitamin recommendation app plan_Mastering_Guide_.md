Design a detailed plan for developing an app focused on vitamin recommendations. Address the following components in the app's functionality and user experience:

- **User Input Interface**: 
  - Design a dropdown menu or interface where users can select one or multiple reasons for seeking vitamin advice. Possible choices should include: weight loss, aging, heart health, brain health, stress relief, better sleep, relief from fatigue, overall health, etc.

- **Recommendation System**:
  - Develop an algorithm or logic that generates a list of recommended vitamins based on the selected reason(s).
  - Provide specific instructions for each recommended vitamin that includes:
    - Daily dosage.
    - Best time of day to take the vitamin.

- **E-commerce Integration**:
  - Include functionality that links each recommended vitamin to a corresponding product on Amazon.
  - Select products based on high ratings to ensure quality recommendations.

- **Future Enhancements Consideration**: 
  - Consider ways to personalize the recommendations further based on user feedback or additional data inputs.
